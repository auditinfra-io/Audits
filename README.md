|[ZKsync Airbender](https://auditinfra-io.github.io/Audits/Zksync-airbender)|STARK/AIR RISC-V zkVM|Feb 2026|No critical findings|

## Scope

These reports cover manual security audits of proof systems, constraint circuits, smart contracts, and cryptographic implementations across multiple ecosystems including Ethereum, Solana, and ZK frameworks (Halo2, SP1, Plonky3, STARK/AIR).

Areas of focus include constraint soundness, memory argument verification, delegation/composition layers, field arithmetic edge cases, Fiat-Shamir transcript binding, and cross-circuit consistency.

## Methodology

Audits combine manual code review with formal reasoning about algebraic constraints. Attack surfaces are systematically enumerated and each vector is investigated independently. Findings are classified as Critical, High, Medium, Low, or Informational.

## Contact

For inquiries about audit engagements or to discuss findings, open an issue or reach out directly.

## Disclaimer

These reports reflect point-in-time assessments of specific codebases. The absence of findings does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. Reports may be redacted to comply with responsible disclosure timelines.
